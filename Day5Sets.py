Sets : sets are used to store multiple items in a variable
       a set is a collection which is unordered ,unchangeable and unindexed
       but you can remove or add items
       sets are written with {}
       sets doesnt have any duplicates
       we can add sets with .add() method
       in solving problems for maths , physics etc we usually take the union or intersection of sets
       The .intersection_update() method will keep only those items which are present in both sets
       The .intersection() method will return all those items which are available in both sets
       The .symmetric_difference_update() will keep those elements which are not available in both sets
       The .symmetric_difference() will return a set with elements which are not available in both sets
