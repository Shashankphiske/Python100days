PYTHON:
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.'''

#Eg:
print("Hello,World!")

'''Python Indentation : Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line
                        Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code'''
'''Python Variables : Variables are data storages and created when we assign any value to it
                      variables dont need to be assigned any type to it and they can even change type   
                      Variables are of different types String,Float,Integers and Boolean etc
                      Eg ; x = 5  
   Comments : Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in code documentation
              comments starts with a # or multiple line comments can be added in ''' '''   
              comments can be used to explain python code
              it can also prevent python from executing code      
   Type casting : If you want to change the data type of a variable ,this can be done by type casting
                  Eg : x = int("4")
   Type function : You can get the data type of any variable with type() function
                  Eg : x = 5
                       print(type(x))
   Variable names : A variable name shouldnt start with a number 
                    It shouldnt have spaces in its name
                    It should be more descriptive, easy to understand and efficient
   Mutli assignments : We can assign multiple values to multiple variables in a single line
                       Eg : x,y,z = 2,3,4
   One value to multiple assignments : Eg : x = y = z = 3
   
   Print function : print() function is often used to output variables or to display something
   
   Int data type : Int,integer or whole number ,positive or negative ,without decimalsof unlimited length
   Float data type : Float or floating point or decimal number is a data type which has decimal point to it 
   Complex data type : complex data types are assigned with a 'j' as a imaginary part
   String data type : Strings in python are surrounded by double quotes or single quotes
                      We can assign multi line strings to a variable by using three quotation marks
                      We can attach to string to each other as "shashank" + "phiske"
                      this is called as string concatenation
   Boolean values : In programming we need to kno if an expression or condition is True or False
                    thus the evaluation of any expression is True or False
                    When we compare two values the expression is evaluated
                    Eg : print(3>4) answer will False
                    Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.   
                    Any string is True, except empty strings.
                    Any number is True, except 0.
                    Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
   Python operators : Operators are used to perform a operation on a variable and values
                      python has :
                        Arithmetic operators
                        Assignment operators
                        Comparison operators
                        Logical operators
                        Identity operators
                        Membership operators
                        Bitwise operators
