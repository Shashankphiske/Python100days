'''
python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics
these conditions can be used in if-else statements

if statement : if condition: (executed only if condition is True)
                    block of code 
               an if statement can exist alone
elif statement : the if statement is False we can try this statement other than the if condition
                 elif condition:
                     block of code
                 elif statement cannot exist alone it needs if statement with it
else statement : it means do this instead if the conditions in if and elif arent met
                 else:
                    block of code
                 else statement cant exist alone it needs if statement
nested if : we can make multiple if statement inside another if statement
