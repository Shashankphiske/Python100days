Arithmetic operators : Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations
                       + : addition
                       - : substraction
                       * : multiplication
                       / : division
                       % : modulus
                       ** : exponential
                       // : Floor division
Assignment operators : Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
                       = : x=5
                       += : x+=5
                       -= : x-=5
                       *= : x*=5
                       /= : x/=5
                       //=
                       **=
                       &=

                       ^=
                       >>=
                       <<=
Comparison operator : Comparison operators are used to compare two values
                      ==
                      !=    
                      >
                      <
                      >=
                      <=
Python logical operators : logical operators are used to combine conditional statements
                           and (returns True if both statements are True)
                           or (returns True if one of the statements in True)
                           not (reverses the result)
Python Identity operator : identity operators are used to compare the objects,not if they are equal,but if they
                           are actualy the same objects,with the same memory location
                           is (returns True if both objects are True
                               eg : x = [2,3,4]
                                    y = [2,3,4]
                                    z = x
                                    print(z is x) True
                                    print(y is x) False)
                           is not
Python membership operators : Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is present in an object
                              in (returns True if sequence available in object
                                  for eg: x = [2,3,4] 
                                          y = 2
                                          print(y in x)
                              not in
Python bitwise operators : Bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers
                           &  (And : sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1)
                           |  (OR : sets each bit to 1 if one of the two bit is 1)
                           ^  (XOR : sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1 )
                           ~  (NOT : inverts all the bits)
                           << (Zero fill left : shift left by pushing zeros in from right and let the leftmost bit fall off)
                           >> (Signed right shift : shift right by pushing copies of leftmost bit in from the left
                               and let the rightmost bit fall off )                                                              '''
