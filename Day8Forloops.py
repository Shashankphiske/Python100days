'''
For loop : a for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (i.e a list,tuple,dictionary,set,or a string )
           we can use range() function to make for loop for a limited number of times
           we can use else statement with for loop once the loop is over and the else statement is executed
           
Nested loops : a nested loop is a loop inside a loop
               the inner loop will be executed first and then the outer loop
